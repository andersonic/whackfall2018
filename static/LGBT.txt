LGBT activists, including and especially transgender activists, often have their personal information published online by harassers, in a process known as doxing. When engaging in doxing, harassers publish the personal information of an activist who they want to humiliate into silence and to encourage violence against that person in real life. Doxing has resulted in death threats against individuals and their families, as well as abusive comments on people's social media pages. Over the past months, legal attempts to restrict the rights of transgender individuals have gained some prominence, while transgender activists in various cities have worked both to create supportive communities for themselves and to prevent their rights from being taken away.
