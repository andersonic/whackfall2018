Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a movement that began in the 1930s in Germany as an attempt to prevent the rise of Naziism. After the fall of the Third Reich, the movement came back, in groups with names such as Antifaschistische Ausschsse, Antifaschistische Kommittees, or the now famous Antifaschistische Aktion Antifa for short. Antifascists take a direct-action approach to preventing fascism from getting a platform, by protesting far-right speakers, attempting to protect marginalized groups from racists, and other tactics. Antifa activists tend to be leftist, and they often ascribe to various sets of anticapitalist principles.
