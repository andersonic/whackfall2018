[name] is an activist with the Black Lives Matter movement, founded in 2013 as a continuation of the tradition of racial equity organizing in the United States that has existed since the end of the Civil War, through reconstruction and the 1960s Civil Rights movement, up until today. Though the #blacklivesmatter hashtag was popularized by Alicia Garza in 2013, and was formed as an organization by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, several movements using the hashtag have formed around the country since then, including the movement following the killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO in 2014. This movement brought national attention to the issue of police violence against black people, The project is now a member-led global network of more than 40 chapters. Members organize and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes. Groups affiliated with #blacklivesmatter include the Movement for Black Lives, Campaign Zero, and various activist groups out of Ferguson and St. Louis, Missouri. The hashtag #blacklivesmatter can describe either a rallying cry that has been used to protest the murders of Black people across the country, or the loose network of activist groups that has grown to advocate for equity for Black people across the country.
