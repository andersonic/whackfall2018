[name] is a journalist who has experienced online harassment due to the publication of divisive work. Over the past several years, many journalists have experienced an increase in online harassment. Reporters Without Borders tracks this harrassment. "The rise in attacks against journalists on the internet is associated with a broader strategy of misinformation," Emmanuel Colombi�, RSF regional director for Latin America, said. The intimidation of journalists, targets of insults and threats to discredit and silence them, is part of this process. Today, orchestrating this kind of action has become relatively simple and inexpensive. In the same way, we see a trend of strong political polarization, which has become a fertile ground for discourses of hatred and intolerance. In this context, journalists were particularly exposed.� Although being a published journalist legally makes an individual a public figure, which often makes the options for journalists trying to respond to online attacks limited, they are often some of the first targeted with on- and offline hate and abuse.
