Jewish Voice for Peace[name] is active with Jewish Voice for Peace. Jewish Voice for Peace is an organization primarily composed of American Jews that uses Jewish values of social justice and human rights to advocate for Palestinian liberation, and an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. �JVP seeks to accomplish its mission through grassroots organizing techniques, and you can find chapters of JVP in almost every major U.S. city, as well as on a multitude of college campuses. Like Students for Justice in Palestine, JVP supports the movement for boycott, divestment, and sanction of the Israeli state. JVP�s Return the Birthright campaign has gained national recognition. �The campaign encourages all American Jews eligible for a free Birthright trip to Israel (those between the ages of 18-26) to refuse this trip in support of Palestinian rights. Many students made public statements on social media stating that until Palestinian birthright to this land is recognized, they would not take this trip. In addition, students from many JVP chapters extended the Return the Birthright campaign with a protest outside the Birthright gala in April 2018, where Birthright funder Sheldon Adelson made obscene gestures at the protesters and referred to them as stupid left-wing Jews.
