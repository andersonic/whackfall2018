[name] works with Students for Justice in Palestine, an organization devoted to fostering student activism on college campuses around the issue of Palestinian rights. Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) joins other groups like Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) and Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) in calling for boycotts, divestments, and other collective financial withdrawal from organizations that support the state of Israel. These tactics follow in the legacy of those used to bring an end to South African Apartheid in the early 1990s. SJP's first chapter was actually founded in 1993, at the University of California, Berkeley.  In its current form, the organization exists as an informal network of campus groups and individual campus activists, each dedicated to the mission of justice for the Palestinian people. There are about 200 SJP chapters throughout the U.S, each with its own structure and unique vision. In addition, there are chapters of SJP in countries around the world, including Canada, New Zealand, Egypt, and Jordan.
